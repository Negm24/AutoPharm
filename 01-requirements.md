# H.A.V.E — Requirements Specification

**Version** 0.8 · **Market:** Egypt (academic scope) · **Scope:** three frontend applications—H.A.V.E Terminal, H.A.V.E Advisor, and H.A.V.E Hub—connected to one central backend, plus a small secured owner-only doctor-approval dashboard. H.A.V.E means **Health Access & Vending Everywhere**. AutoPharm remains the project/repository name. Hardware selection, enclosure, and robotics are out of scope except where Terminal must talk to them.

| #   | Decision                  | Resolution                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| --- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| D-1 | Identity primitive        | **Mobile number + 4-digit PIN.** Verification by SMS one-time code. Fastest thing to enter on a wall-mounted terminal.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| D-2 | Target market             | **Egypt.** Currency EGP, Arabic primary with English secondary, Egyptian regulatory regime throughout.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| D-7 | Guest proof of purchase   | **Resolved by D-3.** A guest prints a receipt at the terminal (ALWAYS for user or guest), or + optionally types an email address, or optionally creates an account afterwards to retain it. No guest leaves with nothing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| D-3 | Receipt delivery          | **Three routes: printed, emailed, stored in the account.** A thermal ESC/POS printer closes the guest gap. Signed-in users always get account storage, with email and print as options; guests get print, or email if they choose to type an address. Every sale also produces an ETA-format e-receipt, generated for real against a mock submission endpoint.                                                                                                                                                         |
| D-5 | Prescription source model | **Independent H.A.V.E Advisor doctor app.** Doctors issue structured prescriptions through the central backend, including before a customer account exists. Doctor signup creates a pending account. The project owner reviews and approves or rejects it through a small secured dashboard; approval activates it directly, without an owner-shared activation code. No clinical-assistant role or prescription draft workflow. Controlled/narcotic medicines are excluded. |
| D-4 | Guidance engine           | **Deterministic guidance service with versioned configuration files.** Product records carry symptom tags for matching. Questions, safety rules, red-flag outcomes, ranking, and bilingual explanations live in reviewed application configuration, not dedicated guidance database tables. No model, LLM, training, or generated recommendations. Product tags alone never bypass safety screening. |
| D-6 | Insurance simulation      | **Simple customer insurance activation.** An activation selects covered products, an expiry date, a configurable coverage percentage (default 75%), and a maximum number of uses per calendar month. The backend checks eligibility and calculates the discount locally. No insurer gateway, plan catalogue, or separate claim-submission workflow is required. |

### 0.2 Implementation scope — graduation project

This is an academic project and will not be operated commercially. Requirements are therefore tiered:

| Tier         | Meaning                                                                                   | Applies to                                                                        |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **BUILD**    | Implemented in code and demonstrable                                                      | Everything in §2, §3, §4 unless noted                                             |
| **DOCUMENT** | Analysed and written up, not implemented                                                  | §5 regulatory and privacy requirements                                            |
| **SIMULATE** | Real logic, stubbed endpoint — the thing the endpoint would receive is genuinely produced | Payment (including provider-backed saved methods), dispensing hardware, SMS gateway, ETA submission; insurance is a local mock calculation |

The receipt printer is real hardware and cheap, so it is BUILD rather than SIMULATE. Keep the print path behind an interface so the system still runs end-to-end if the printer is unavailable on demo day — a hardware failure in front of examiners should degrade to on-screen, not crash the flow.

The ETA e-receipt is the clearest example of SIMULATE done properly: the document structure, field set, digital signature, UUID and verification QR are all generated for real; only the HTTP call to the Tax Authority is mocked. A stub that returns `{"status":"ok"}` without building the document teaches nothing and demos nothing.

§5 is retained deliberately: a graduation project that identifies the legal constraints on its own product and explains why it cannot lawfully operate as-is demonstrates more engineering maturity than one that ignores them. **Write it up, present it, do not build to it.** Where a regulatory requirement is cheap to honour anyway (audit logging, data minimisation, PIN hashing), build it — it costs nothing and strengthens the demo.

### 0.3 Decision status

D-4 and D-6 are resolved above. Exact fictional insurance percentages and product exclusions are configurable demo data, not an external-integration dependency.

## 1. Context and actors

**System boundary.** Three independent frontends use one central backend: **H.A.V.E Terminal** runs on a 1024×600 kiosk touchscreen, **H.A.V.E Advisor** is the doctor web app, and **H.A.V.E Hub** is the customer app usable from home. The frontends communicate through the backend, never directly with one another. A fourth frontend, **H.A.V.E Operation**, is only an idea on standby; it is not part of this build.

| Actor                  | Interaction                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Guest customer         | Walks up, browses, uses symptom guidance, buys OTC, leaves. No account. Majority of traffic.                       |
| Account holder         | Signs up through Terminal or Hub; uses either to access claimed prescriptions, saved insurance, and order history. |
| Prescribing doctor     | Uses Advisor to issue or revoke a structured prescription addressed to a patient's phone, even before an account exists. |
| Project owner / approver | Uses a secured, owner-only dashboard to review pending doctor applications and approve or reject them. Receives application notifications at a configured email address. |
| Operator / back office | Initially manages catalogue, pricing, planogram, and stock through controlled backend/database procedures; no Operation app yet. |
| Payment provider mock  | Simulated digital payment authorisation and capture; no physical card reader.                                      |
| Email service          | Transactional delivery of codes and receipts.                                                                      |

## 2. Functional requirements

### 2.1 Session lifecycle

- **FR-1** The terminal shall display an attract screen when idle and begin a session on first touch.
- **FR-2** Each session shall be anonymous by default; no identity is required to start.
- **FR-3** The app shall maintain an inactivity timer, warn the user before expiry, and allow extension.
- **FR-3a** Terminal inactivity shall expire the session after 70 seconds without meaningful user interaction. The backend shall also enforce a non-extendable 10-minute maximum from session start, not displayed as a countdown. Polling, heartbeat, or silent token refresh shall not count as user activity or extend this maximum. FR-7 governs safe handling of an in-flight payment or dispense at expiry.
- **FR-4** On expiry, cancellation, or completion, the app shall destroy all session state — cart, identity, prescription data, entered text, and cached personal data — and return to attract.
- **FR-5** A session shall never be resumable by the next person at the terminal.
- **FR-6** The app shall expose a Cancel / Start Over action from every in-session screen.
- **FR-7** Session termination during an in-flight payment or dispense shall be blocked until that operation reaches a terminal state.

### 2.2 Language

- **FR-8** The app shall support Arabic and English, non-switchable, decided by user initially.
- **FR-8a** Language shall be chosen explicitly by the user as the **first step of every session**, immediately after the attract screen — two equal side-by-side choices, ATM-style. No language is pre-selected and no default is assumed.
- **FR-9** All layouts shall mirror correctly for RTL.
- **FR-10** Product names, categories, dosage instructions, and warnings shall be stored and displayed in both languages.
- **FR-11** Numerals shall follow the selected locale convention (the design uses Arabic-Indic digits in the Arabic views).

### 2.3 Browse, search, product detail

- **FR-12** Browsing by category shall be the primary discovery path; any stocked item shall be reachable within two taps from the main menu.
- **FR-13** The app shall provide search across both languages, including partial matches, common misspellings, brand and generic names, and active ingredient.
- **FR-14** Search and browse shall show only items physically stocked in _this_ terminal.
- **FR-15** Prescription-only items shall be clearly badged and shall not be addable to the cart without a validated prescription.
- **FR-16** Product detail shall present price, active ingredient, dosage form, pack size, usage instructions, warnings, and stock status.
- **FR-17** Live stock levels shall be reflected in the UI; an item that goes out of stock mid-session shall be surfaced before checkout, not after payment.

### 2.4 Symptom guidance

- **FR-18** The app shall offer a guided, stepwise symptom flow available to guests without an account.
- **FR-19** The flow shall collect symptom, duration, and severity at minimum, and shall screen for red-flag conditions.
- **FR-20** On detecting a red flag (severe symptoms, long duration, pregnancy, paediatric age, chronic conditions, drug interactions), the app shall stop recommending and route to a pharmacist or emergency guidance.
- **FR-21** Recommendations shall be limited to OTC items stocked in this terminal, ranked, each with a plain-language rationale.
- **FR-21a** A deterministic guidance service shall use product symptom tags and reviewed rules to return ranked eligible products with a one-sentence explanation. No model, LLM, training, or generated recommendation is permitted. Symptom tags are discovery metadata, not a claim that a product cures a condition.
- **FR-21b** Questions, branches, safety rules, ranking, and bilingual explanations shall live in versioned application configuration files and be available offline alongside the catalogue. No dedicated guidance database tables are required. Results shall be filtered against terminal stock and safety restrictions; red flags return escalation rather than products. Personal symptom answers shall not be retained beyond FR-24.
- **FR-22** A medical disclaimer shall be displayed on every recommendation screen.
- **FR-23** The app shall never state or imply a diagnosis.
- **FR-24** Symptom inputs shall be treated as health data and discarded at session end. If retained for analytics, they shall be irreversibly anonymised.

### 2.5 Cart

- **FR-25** Users shall add, remove, and change quantities of items.
- **FR-26** Quantity shall be capped per item by stock level and by any regulatory maximum.
- **FR-27** Stock for cart contents shall be soft-reserved on add, with a timeout, so two adjacent terminals or a concurrent session cannot oversell the same unit.
- **FR-28** The cart shall show a running total, itemised, before any payment step.

### 2.6 Identity and accounts

- **FR-29** Terminal sign-in shall be requested only at the point it is needed: prescriptions, saved insurance, order history, or saved payment. Hub may offer sign-in when the customer opens the app.
- **FR-30** Sign-in shall use **mobile number + 4-digit PIN**, entered on a numeric keypad with masked PIN entry.
- **FR-30a** Mobile numbers shall be validated against Egyptian numbering (11-digit national format, 010/011/012/015 prefixes) and stored in a single canonical form (E.164) regardless of how the user types them.
- **FR-31** Sign-up shall be available through either Terminal (completable in under two minutes) or Hub from the customer's own device. Both routes shall verify control of the mobile number via an SMS one-time code and create an account in the same central backend.
- **FR-31a** Customer and doctor accounts shall be distinct. A doctor who wishes to shop shall create a separate customer account. Readable primary keys use `HAV-C887-000000000001` / `HAV-D887-000000000002`, with phone suffix captured at creation and a database sequence plus PK constraint guaranteeing uniqueness. IDs remain unchanged after phone updates. Phone and case-insensitive email shall each be unique within account type, permitting reuse across doctor/customer accounts. Hub/Terminal authentication and prescription lookup select CUSTOMER; Advisor authentication selects DOCTOR. Owner accounts are provisioned privately, never through public signup.
- **FR-35a** Hub and Advisor shall use 15-minute access tokens and database-backed refresh-token sessions. Remember Me selects a fixed refresh-session lifetime of 7 days; otherwise it is 1 day. Token rotation shall not extend the original session expiry. Remember Me shall not be offered on public Terminals. Browser token storage, rotation, revocation, and Redis behavior shall follow the finalized security policy in the technology-stack document.
- **FR-32** PIN reset shall be possible at the kiosk without staff involvement, in this exact sequence: enter mobile number → _Forgot PIN?_ → SMS containing a **6-digit reset code** → enter code → set a new **4-digit PIN** → confirm new PIN → signed in.
- **FR-32a** The 6-digit reset code shall be single-use, shall expire on a short timer, and shall be invalidated once a new PIN is set or a newer code is issued.
- **FR-32b** Note the deliberate asymmetry: the **PIN is 4 digits** (typed often, protected by lockout) while the **reset code is 6 digits** (typed once, must resist guessing because it can change the PIN).
- **FR-33** A QR fast path shall allow Terminal sign-in by scanning a short-lived, one-use code displayed by Hub, with explicit confirmation on the customer's device.
- **FR-34** Repeated failed PIN attempts shall lock the account temporarily, with exponential back-off, and the attempt counter shall be enforced server-side.
- **FR-34a** Because a 4-digit PIN has only 10,000 combinations, the system shall additionally rate-limit per mobile number, per terminal, and per source, and shall reject trivially guessable PINs (repeated digits, sequences, common patterns).
- **FR-34b** _(DOCUMENT, not BUILD)_ Recycled mobile numbers: in production, prolonged account inactivity would force re-verification before prescription or insurance data is exposed, so a reassigned number could not inherit a stranger's medical history. Unclaimed prescriptions addressed to a phone number carry the same risk; safe real-world claiming would require stronger patient matching than phone possession alone. Out of scope for the project build; document this production gap explicitly.
- **FR-34c** SMS delivery failure shall not strand the user — offer resend, an alternative channel where available, and a clear route to continue as a guest.
- **FR-35** Sign-out shall be automatic at session end and available manually at any time.
- **FR-36** A guest shall be able to complete an OTC purchase without ever creating an account, and account creation shall never be a precondition for payment.

### 2.7 Prescriptions

- **FR-37** A signed-in user shall see their claimed prescriptions in Terminal and Hub, split into current and previous, with issuing doctor, clinic, date, and status.
- **FR-38** Prescription detail shall show each line item with quantity prescribed, quantity already dispensed, refills remaining, and availability in this terminal.
- **FR-39** The app shall clearly mark line items this terminal cannot fulfil and state why (not stocked, out of stock, or expired stock). All products admitted to the prototype catalogue shall be machine-dispensable.
- **FR-40** Partial fulfilment shall be supported: the user may collect what is available while the remainder stays open for another kiosk or a branch.
- **FR-41** Every dispense against a prescription shall be recorded atomically against that prescription so the same units cannot be dispensed twice at two terminals.
- **FR-42** Expired, fully dispensed, and revoked prescriptions shall be non-dispensable and clearly labelled.
- **FR-43** The system shall enforce controlled-substance rules for the target jurisdiction, including any items the machine must refuse entirely.
- **FR-44** Prescription data shall be fetched per session and never cached on the terminal beyond session end.
- **FR-44a** A prescriber may issue a structured prescription to a patient's canonical phone number before an account exists. The backend shall retain it as **unclaimed**, without creating a patient account or making it dispensable.
- **FR-44b** For this academic build, a customer shall prove control of the prescription's exact canonical phone number and explicitly confirm a claim before attachment. That verified phone is the assignment key; manually entered name/DOB differences shall not themselves block a claim. No prescription contents shall be shown before the phone-ownership and authorization checks pass. A typed number alone shall never reveal contents or authorize a claim. This simplified rule does not prove real-world patient identity; the recycled-number/misassignment risk remains documented under FR-34b.
- **FR-44c** A prescription claimed through Hub shall be usable from any eligible Terminal after sign-in, subject to the same prescription validity, stock, and dispensing checks. The person shall not have to return to the doctor merely to have it assigned to a newly created account.
- **FR-44d** Claims with an unverified or different phone number, an existing conflicting customer link, or a dispute shall be blocked. Expired or revoked prescriptions shall not become dispensable through claiming. Name/DOB differences alone follow the account-priority rule in FR-44f. Issue, claim, correction, and dispense actions shall remain traceable through business records and restricted logs.
- **FR-44e** An authorized, approved doctor may look up an existing customer by exact canonical phone number during prescription creation. Advisor shall autofill `patient_phone_number`, `patient_first_name`, `patient_last_name`, and `patient_date_of_birth` from the linked customer identity/profile; the doctor shall confirm the intended patient. Return only these minimum fields, with rate limiting and no public lookup endpoint. If no customer exists, the doctor shall enter these fields manually.
- **FR-44f** The prescription's originally assigned `patient_phone_number` shall not be overwritten from subsequent account changes. When the account for that verified phone is linked under FR-44b, its `first_name`, `last_name`, and `date_of_birth` shall replace the prescription's working/displayed name and DOB, even if the doctor's manual entries differ. For example, an entry for Youssef Negm becomes Mohamed Ahmed when the verified account for the assigned phone contains that name. Retain the original issued identity snapshot separately for historical verification; current customer details have display priority, while the original assignment phone remains fixed.

### 2.8 Insurance

- **FR-45** A signed-in customer may activate mock insurance covering a configured set of products, with an expiry date and a maximum number of uses per calendar month.
- **FR-45a** The coverage percentage shall be configurable, defaulting to 75%. Coverage applies only to covered products; other items remain full price. No insurer gateway, insurance-plan catalogue, deductibles, or separate claim-submission tables are required. The monthly-use timezone and concurrent-use reservation rules shall be resolved during session/order design.
- **FR-46** Insurance shall be applied as an optional, skippable step immediately before payment.
- **FR-47** Applying a policy shall recalculate the total live and show an itemised breakdown: subtotal, covered amount, patient pays.
- **FR-48** Per-item coverage differences shall be visible, including items not covered at all.
- **FR-49** The backend shall check ownership, activation, expiry, covered products, and remaining monthly uses before reducing the price. Concurrent checkouts shall not exceed the monthly limit.
- **FR-50** Unavailable, expired, or exhausted insurance shall allow the customer to continue at full price after confirming the revised total.
- **FR-51** Final coverage shall reflect actual dispensed items. A cancelled or entirely failed purchase shall not consume a monthly use; an eligible completed or partially completed purchase consumes one use. Orders shall retain the applied insurance reference and coverage snapshot for counting and receipt accuracy.

Order status shall use only `PENDING`, `DISPENSING`, `CANCELLED`, `COMPLETED`, and `REVIEW_REQUIRED`. Confirmed per-line quantities represent partial fulfilment without a separate `PARTIAL` status. Uncertain payment or hardware outcomes require review, not a blind retry. A separate dispense-attempts table is not required.

### 2.9 Payment

- **FR-52** The app shall support digitally mocked payment without a physical card reader, and cash if the hardware is fitted.
- **FR-53** The H.A.V.E backend and frontends shall never capture or store raw card data. At Terminal and in Hub, the academic payment-provider flow is simulated without real card credentials; saving a method returns an opaque reference.
- **FR-54** Payment screens shall give clear digital confirmation instructions and live status; they shall not instruct customers to use a card reader.
- **FR-55** Authorisation shall precede dispensing; capture shall follow successful dispensing.
- **FR-56** A failed or declined payment shall return the user to a recoverable state with the cart intact and an alternative offered.
- **FR-57** Payment shall be idempotent: no retry, timeout, or reconnect may charge a customer twice.
- **FR-57a** Hub shall let an authenticated customer save and remove provider-backed payment methods for later use at any Terminal. The backend shall store only provider-issued references/tokens and display-safe metadata, never a card number, security code, or other raw payment credentials.
- **FR-57b** At Terminal, using a saved method shall require an explicit customer-approved, amount-specific payment action and normal provider authorization. The flow should avoid repeated card-detail entry where the provider permits; it shall not promise to bypass an OTP or other verification required by the issuer or provider.

### 2.10 Dispensing

- **FR-58** The app shall command the dispensing subsystem per item and track per-item outcome.
- **FR-59** Dispensing progress shall be shown live, with a clear instruction to collect from the drawer.
- **FR-60** A dispense failure after a successful charge shall trigger an automatic refund or credit, notify the user on screen with a reference number, and raise an operational alert.
- **FR-61** The app shall not consider an order complete until every item is confirmed dispensed or explicitly reconciled as failed.
- **FR-62** Inventory shall be decremented on confirmed dispense, not on payment.
- **FR-63** The app shall detect and report an uncollected drawer.

### 2.11 Receipts and order history

- **FR-64** Every completed order shall generate a receipt available by three routes: **printed** at the terminal, **emailed**, and **stored in the account**.
- **FR-64a** For a signed-in user the receipt shall **always** be stored against the account immediately on completion, independently of any delivery choice made at the terminal, and shall be retrievable from **any terminal in the fleet** at any time. Account storage is the durable copy; print and email are convenience copies.
- **FR-64b** Print shall be offered to every user, signed in or guest. It is the primary route for guests, who have no account to store into and may not wish to type an email address.
- **FR-64c** Email shall be offered alongside account storage for signed-in users, pre-filled where an address is on file so it costs a single tap.
- **FR-64d** The completion screen shall also **display** the receipt — line items, insurance breakdown, total, order reference — so it can be read or photographed before the user leaves.
- **FR-64e** Printer faults (paper out, jam, offline) shall be detected **before** the print option is offered; the option shall be hidden or disabled rather than failing after selection. Paper level shall be reported on the fleet monitoring heartbeat (FR-74).
- **FR-64f** A print failure after a completed sale shall never lose the receipt: fall back to on-screen display and offer email.
- **FR-64g** PDF download shall be offered in Hub, not on Terminal. A kiosk has no user device attached, so a download there would write a file to the terminal's own filesystem where the user can never retrieve it.
- **FR-65** A user choosing email shall enter the address via the keyboard overlay; a visible skip shall always be present and skipping shall not block completion.
- **FR-66** A guest shall be offered optional account creation after payment, which shall retroactively attach the just-completed receipt to the new account; this shall be skippable and shall not block completion.
- **FR-67** Signed-in users shall access receipt history from any terminal, with full line items, insurance breakdown, reprint and resend-by-email at the kiosk, and PDF download on the web.
- **FR-68** _(SIMULATE)_ Every sale shall generate an **Egyptian Tax Authority e-receipt** in ETA's structured format, carrying issuer and branch identifiers, terminal serial, timestamp, item lines, VAT detail, totals, currency, and a UUID. Since a real taxpayer registration and e-seal certificate are unobtainable for an academic project, the document shall be signed with a self-generated key and the submission endpoint mocked — structure, signing, UUID and QR generation are real; only the transmission is stubbed.
- **FR-68a** The ETA verification QR shall be generated as part of the e-receipt and shall appear on the printed and emailed forms. It is a tax-verification artifact, not a download link; for this project it will not resolve against the real ETA portal, so point it at your own verification page or state plainly in the demo that it is inert.
- **FR-68b** ETA submission shall be queued and retried within the permitted submission window; an ETA outage shall never block a sale or hold the customer at the machine.
- **FR-68c** ETA acceptance and rejection responses shall be processed, persisted, and alerted on.

### 2.12 Help, emergencies, edge cases

- **FR-69** A pharmacist contact action shall be available from every screen.
- **FR-70** An emergency screen shall provide Egyptian emergency numbers — **112 unified, 123 ambulance** — the nearest hospital, and this terminal's exact physical location, and shall state plainly that the kiosk cannot help in an emergency.
- **FR-71** The app shall present designed states for: out of stock, partial fulfilment, payment declined, insurance rejected or unreachable, network offline, session timeout warning, dispense failure, and terminal out of service.
- **FR-72** Every error state shall offer at least one forward action and shall never dead-end.
- **FR-73** When the terminal cannot trade, the attract screen shall say so before the user invests effort in a session.

### 2.13 Catalogue and stock data

Hardware maintenance mode, diagnostics, and technician access belong to the hardware collaborators; this software team does not build a technician app or maintenance-mode interface.

- **FR-74** The terminal shall report health, stock levels, peripheral status, and connectivity to the central service on a heartbeat.
- Terminal records shall include `is_disabled`, default `false`; disabled terminals shall not start new purchases. Heartbeat freshness may live in Redis; a persistent `last_seen_at` column is not required. Batch, slot, per-terminal stock, and reservation records remain in the inventory design.
- **FR-75** Catalogue, pricing, stock, and planogram shall be stored centrally and made available to Terminal and Hub as appropriate. Initially, the software project team shall configure product and price records using controlled seed/database procedures; stock shall still change through restock and confirmed-dispense transactions. A dedicated H.A.V.E Operation frontend is deferred.
- **FR-76** The system shall track batch and expiry per stocked unit and shall block dispensing of expired stock.
- **FR-78** Software updates shall be deployable remotely to the fleet and shall never interrupt an active session.
- **FR-79** Business records shall retain payment outcomes, confirmed dispensed quantities, prescription changes, and applied insurance. Security-sensitive actions shall produce restricted structured logs without secrets or unnecessary health data. A separate generic audit-events table is not required. Dispense confirmation and recovery data may live on order lines and the device journal rather than a separate dispense-attempts table.

### 2.14 H.A.V.E Advisor doctor app

- **FR-80** Advisor shall be an independent doctor-facing web application with its own authentication and authorization boundary. A small separately protected owner-only doctor-approval dashboard shall be provided through the central backend. It is not a general operations/admin application or a clinical-assistant interface.
- **FR-81** Advisor shall communicate only with the central backend and shall never connect directly to Terminal or Hub.
- **FR-82** Doctor signup shall collect identity/contact and professional details plus a strong password and create a **pending** doctor account. No simulated professional-registry integration is required.
- **FR-82a** Signup shall notify the configured owner email of the pending application without including passwords, hashes, or secrets. Reviewable application details shall be available only in the secured dashboard.
- **FR-82b** The authenticated project owner shall review and explicitly approve or reject applications in the dashboard. The backend shall record the decision, decision time, approver, and an optional rejection reason. Approval activates the account directly; no doctor activation code or approval-code table is required.
- **FR-82c** Pending doctor sign-in shall show **Waiting for Approval** without prescribing access. An approved doctor may sign in under the doctor authentication policy. A rejected doctor shall remain blocked and see an appropriate status message.
- **FR-82d** Dashboard access shall be owner-only, provisioned outside public signup, and protected by strong authentication, server-side authorization, rate limits, CSRF protection where applicable, and short-lived sessions. Ordinary doctors and customers shall not receive approval permissions. Dashboard security and session details shall be finalized before implementation.
- The owner dashboard shall use a restricted Django admin interface and native server-side Django sessions, with no Remember Me option, a 10-minute inactivity limit, and a 2-hour non-extendable absolute maximum. It does not use the personal apps' JWT refresh flow.
- **FR-84** Doctors shall use a strong password and TOTP MFA through an existing authenticator app. Advisor shall provide enrollment and code-entry screens; no additional H.A.V.E frontend is required. The encrypted enrollment secret is durable; temporary challenges remain in Redis. Owner approval is activation, not login MFA. Issuing a prescription requires recent authentication or reauthentication.
- **FR-87** Before issuing, the doctor shall confirm patient identity and canonical phone number. Exact-phone lookup shall autofill an existing customer's minimum identity details under FR-44e. Otherwise the doctor shall enter them manually and issue an unclaimed prescription. Doctor lookup does not authorize a customer claim or reveal prescriptions, order history, or other account data.
- **FR-88** The authoritative prescription shall be structured data, not an uploaded PDF or image. It shall record the intended patient's identifying details and phone number (and account link only after a safe claim), prescriber, clinic, issue and expiry timestamps, medicine identifiers, dosage instructions, quantity, refill rules, status and signature metadata.
- **FR-89** Only an authorized doctor account may issue a prescription. There is no delegated draft or review workflow.
- **FR-90** Advisor shall support prescription revocation with a required reason, actor and timestamp. Signed clinical content shall be versioned rather than overwritten.
- **FR-91** Doctor signup, owner approval/rejection, login, prescription issue, and revocation shall be traceable through business records and restricted structured logs. No generic audit-events table is required.
- **FR-92** Controlled and narcotic medicines shall be excluded from the Advisor prototype.
- **FR-93** Advisor shall show prescription delivery/claim/status information from the central backend but shall not directly command dispensing hardware.

### 2.15 H.A.V.E Hub customer app

- **FR-94** Hub shall be a separate customer-facing app usable away from a Terminal, connected to the same central backend and customer accounts.
- **FR-95** A customer shall be able to create an account at home, verify a phone number, sign in, reset a PIN, and view claimed prescriptions and order/receipt history. A customer who has no account when the doctor issues a prescription may register later and claim it without another clinic visit, subject to FR-44b–FR-44d.
- **FR-96** Hub shall show nearby Terminal locations using a map or location list, with address and availability status. The customer shall be able to select a location manually without granting device-location access.
- **FR-97** Hub shall let customers browse/search the catalogue and check product availability and price for a selected Terminal. Availability is advisory and timestamped; it is not a reservation or guarantee until the backend confirms a checkout reservation.
- **FR-98** Hub shall support managing saved provider-backed payment methods for faster in-person checkout, subject to FR-57a–FR-57b. Saving a payment method shall be optional and shall not be required to browse, claim a prescription, or pay through another supported route.

- **NFR-7** The catalogue, browse, search, symptom guidance, and cart shall function with the network down.
- **NFR-8** Prescriptions, insurance, account sign-in, and mocked digital payment require connectivity; their unavailability shall degrade gracefully to a clearly explained cash-and-OTC mode if cash hardware is fitted, rather than taking the terminal offline.
- **NFR-9** No single failure — network, backend, insurer, email — shall be able to take money without delivering goods, or deliver goods without recording the transaction.
- **NFR-10** Transactions interrupted by power loss shall be reconciled automatically on restart.

- **NFR-24** Alerting on dispense failure, payment anomaly, low stock, peripheral fault, and terminal unreachable.
- **NFR-25** Analytics shall never log personal or health data in identifiable form.

---

## 4. Security requirements

- **SEC-1** All traffic between terminal and backend shall be TLS 1.2+ with certificate validation; a terminal shall refuse to operate on an untrusted connection.
- **SEC-2** Each terminal shall authenticate device-agent requests using its protected per-terminal credential. Store one credential hash on the terminal record; no separate credentials table is required. Disabling the terminal or replacing its credential revokes device access. Raw credentials shall never be embedded in frontend JavaScript.
- **SEC-3** PINs shall be stored only as salted hashes with a modern KDF, never in plaintext or recoverable form, and never on the terminal.
- **SEC-4** Authentication, rate limiting, lockout, and all authorisation decisions shall be enforced server-side. The terminal is untrusted.
- **SEC-5** PIN and code entry shall be masked, resistant to shoulder-surfing, and shall not appear in logs, analytics, crash reports, or screenshots.
- **SEC-6** The terminal shall run in a locked-down kiosk mode with no access to the OS, browser chrome, file system, developer tools, external navigation, or system settings.
- **SEC-7** Ports, debug interfaces, and remote-access channels shall be disabled or authenticated in production.
- **SEC-8** Card data shall never enter application scope; the integration shall be designed to keep the app out of PCI DSS scope as far as possible, and the residual scope shall be documented.
- **SEC-9** Session tokens shall be short-lived, bound to the terminal and session, and invalidated on session end.
- **SEC-10** Personal and health data shall be encrypted at rest centrally and shall not be persisted on the terminal.
- **SEC-11** Prescription access shall be authorised per request against the authenticated account; a terminal shall never be able to enumerate prescriptions.
- **SEC-12** Doctor activation/rejection shall require authenticated owner-dashboard authorization. Prescription issue/revocation and refunds shall require their respective server-side permissions. Decisions and financial outcomes shall be retained in business records and security actions in restricted logs; no generic audit-events table is required. Hardware maintenance belongs to the hardware team; initial prices remain database-configured.
- **SEC-13** Input from every source shall be validated server-side. Guidance tree and lookup-table publications shall be validated for valid branches, reachable outcomes, permitted products, and safety restrictions before distribution. Offline guidance shall use a validated versioned snapshot; client recommendations shall never bypass backend checkout or prescribing authorization.
- **SEC-14** The system shall defend against automated abuse of the code-sending endpoints (email bombing, enumeration of registered accounts).
- **SEC-15** Physical tamper events shall be detectable and shall raise an alert.
- **SEC-16** Terminal and Hub customer sessions shall have separate token/session policies. A Hub login or saved method shall never silently authorize a Terminal payment, and any Terminal session shall be cleared for the next visitor.
- **SEC-17** Unclaimed prescription lookup and claim attempts shall be server-side rate-limited and audited, shall not expose whether a phone number has a prescription to an unauthorized caller, and shall enforce the patient-detail checks in FR-44b. Disputed claims shall be suspended until reviewed.
- **SEC-18** Saved payment-method references shall be bound to the customer account, usable only after server-side authorization and the payment-provider's required checks, and revocable by the customer. Raw card data shall remain outside H.A.V.E application storage.

## 5. Privacy and regulatory — Egypt

> **Scope: DOCUMENT, not BUILD.** This section is written up for the report and defence, not implemented. It is a legal summary, not legal advice. If this project were ever commercialised, every item here would need confirmation by an Egyptian lawyer with pharmacy-sector experience.

### 5.1 Pharmacy practice — the project's largest open risk

Pharmacy practice in Egypt is regulated by the Ministry of Health and the **Egyptian Drug Authority (EDA)**, with **Law No. 127 of 1955** as the foundational statute. That law frames pharmacy as a licensed technical profession: the pharmacist prepares and dispenses medicines, dispensing of prescription-only medicines follows a licensed physician's prescription, and the pharmacist may not determine treatment or dosage for prescription-only drugs.

Nothing in the available public material establishes a framework authorising an **unattended machine** to perform dispensing without a licensed pharmacist. Three consequences:

- **REG-1** In a commercial deployment the legal basis for automated dispensing would have to be established with the EDA before development. This project proceeds on the explicit stated assumption that it is a non-operational prototype.
- **REG-2** A commercial version would likely need a **pharmacist-in-the-loop**: a licensed pharmacist reviewing and authorising dispenses remotely, with identity and decision recorded per transaction. Worth naming in the report as the single largest gap between the prototype and a deployable product, since it is architectural rather than cosmetic.
- **REG-3** The symptom-recommendation feature sits close to the line Law 127 draws around determining treatment. Even in a prototype, constrain it strictly to OTC guidance and keep the disclaimer prominent — an examiner will probe this, and "we recognised the boundary and designed within it" is a much better answer than not having noticed.

### 5.2 Other Egyptian regulatory requirements

- **REG-4** Only products registered with the EDA may be dispensed; displayed product information shall match approved labelling.
- **REG-5** Pricing shall respect Egypt's regulated medicine pricing regime.
- **REG-6** Controlled and narcotic substances shall be handled per the Egyptian schedule, up to and including outright exclusion from the machine. Recommended default for v1: **exclude entirely.**
- **REG-7** The system shall be able to report dispensing events to Egypt's pharmaceutical **track-and-trace regime (EPTTS)**, which monitors EPCIS events including dispensing. This implies capturing serialisation data per pack at restock and at dispense.
- **REG-8** Recall handling: the system shall be able to identify and immobilise affected batches across the fleet on command.
- **REG-9** VAT shall be applied per Egyptian rules, with medicine-specific treatment confirmed with a tax adviser.

### 5.3 Data protection — PDPL

Egypt's **Personal Data Protection Law No. 151 of 2020** became fully operational with Executive Regulations issued by Decree No. 816 on 1 November 2025, supervised by the **Personal Data Protection Centre (PDPC)**. A one-year grace period runs to **31 October 2026** — which is roughly two months from now, so this system will be built into a fully enforced regime, not a permissive one.

- **PRV-1** Prescription contents, symptom inputs, and purchase history constitute **health data** and shall be treated as sensitive personal data under the PDPL.
- **PRV-2** The applicable **PDPC licences or permits** shall be identified early — the licensing regime attaches to collecting, storing, transferring and processing electronic personal data, with separate licences for cross-border transfer, electronic marketing, and video surveillance. **Any camera on the kiosk may trigger the surveillance licence.** The PDPC application portal was expected to open around mid-2026; confirm current status.
- **PRV-3** A **Data Protection Officer** shall be appointed if the Regulations require one for this processing profile.
- **PRV-4** **Data residency:** hosting personal data outside Egypt is a cross-border transfer requiring authorisation. This constrains cloud region choice and must be settled before infrastructure is procured.
- **PRV-5** Consent shall be explicit, informed, and recorded; the privacy notice shall be reachable on the terminal in Arabic and English before any personal data is entered.
- **PRV-6** Data minimisation: guests shall remain unidentified, and the kiosk shall collect only what the transaction requires.
- **PRV-7** Screens showing personal or prescription data shall auto-clear on a short timer independent of the main session timeout.
- **PRV-8** Users shall be able to exercise access, correction, erasure, and objection rights.
- **PRV-9** Retention shall be defined per data class: dispensing records kept as long as pharmacy and tax law require (tax records at least five years), symptom and analytics data anonymised early.
- **PRV-10** Breach notification procedures shall meet the PDPC's timelines.
- **PRV-11** Processor contracts (SMS gateway, payment processor, cloud host, email provider) shall carry PDPL-compliant terms.
- **PRV-12** No camera imagery shall be retained beyond the decode operation it was captured for.

## 7. Constraints and assumptions

- **C-1** 1024×600 landscape touchscreen, finger input, no physical keyboard.
- **C-2** 50–150 SKUs per terminal — small enough to browse exhaustively.
- **C-3** Unattended public placement; every user is assumed to be a stranger and a first-time user.
- **C-4** Bilingual Arabic/English is mandatory. The user picks the language at the start of every session; neither is pre-selected.
- **C-6** Currency is EGP. Prices are regulated and change by government decision, so pricing must be centrally updatable at short notice.
- **C-7** Cash remains significant in the Egyptian retail market; a card-only terminal will exclude a meaningful share of customers.
- **C-5** Network connectivity is assumed intermittent, not guaranteed.
- **A-1** Doctors issue structured digital prescriptions through Advisor into the central backend, including for people who have not registered, and never interact directly with a Terminal.
- **A-2** Restocking is manual and periodic; the app does not control inventory arrival.
- **A-3** A licensed pharmacist is reachable during defined hours. **For a future commercial deployment, any pharmacist-authorisation requirement discussed in REG-2 would affect operating hours and staffing; this is independent of the resolved D-4 guidance algorithm.**
- **A-4** The operator holds, or can obtain, the pharmacy licence under which these machines trade.
